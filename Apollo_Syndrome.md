The central point of chapter 2 of the book is the reasons why strong teams with clever people
failed.
1. Mismanagement of time: The Apollo team members spent a large part of their time
engaged in abortive debate, trying to persuade the other members of the team to adopt
their own particular, well-stated point of view. They argued on the things that are not
necessary and they don’t reach conclusions on the most important things.
2. Diﬃcult members: Members are partial in their decision making. The members are
diﬃcult to manage. The key problem was those highly talented individuals failing to
work as eﬀectively as a team as the mission desired.
3. Discrimination among members: Some members of the team focuses more on their per-
sonal gains than the purpose of the team. Sentiment kills goals.
4. Lack of proper communication: Communication were very poor within the teams. The
teams were most vulnerable at the level of communication.
5. Competition among members: High levels of competition and negativity and the tendency
to tear down others’ ideas damaged the team’s eﬀorts. Competition for recognition among
members aﬀects the Apollo team.
6. Selﬁsh Ambition: Apollo teams refuse to work together towards achieving the team goals
because of selﬁsh interest. They don’t understand one another. They believe in individual
ability rather than combining the ability together. The lack of coherent teamwork nullify
the gains of individual eﬀort or brilliance.
7. Indecision: No coherence in the decisions that the team reached. No mutual agreement
among the teams. They showed undue respect for each other’s proposals. Apollo teams
are fun of destructive debate and indecision.
8. Cash ﬂow problems: There was no cash ﬂow at the moment.
9. Incompatible of team members
